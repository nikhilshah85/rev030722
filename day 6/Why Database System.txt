OOPS 
	Class
	4 Pillars of OOPS
	Exception handling
	Serialization
		Save the object to disk
		bring the object back to memory
		This is good when users are less, operations are less, security requiremenrs are less
		
	and thus we need to save data to a more secured medium
		users may be in millions, security becomes a priority, operations would be more than 
			billion over a period of year

			Thus database systems (Oracle, SQl Server DB2 etc..)
			Are to be used for enterprise applications

		.net application communicates with database using libraries
			ADO.net (Active X database object)
			EF (Entity Framework)


		a. SQL Server (download this, install this and understand different service)
		b. use a tool (SSMS, SQL Server management studio) to connect to sql server
		c. Demo from trainer (How to create sql server on Azure cloud, and connect to cloud db)

		SQL Server Editions	
			SQl Server Express (Totally free, has a data limit of 2GB)
			SQl Server Standard (Have features for SQl, does not have enterprise feature, 
						MSBI, clustering, mirroring, 
			SQL Server Developer (low licence fee, will have all the features but can 
					be used only develoment machine)
			SQl Server enterprise (All features, this is the one used in Production)







		if 1 machine goes down, 2nd machine server the request
		if 2nd goes goes down, 3rd is available

		DBA's (SQL Server Admins takes care of this)

		clusturing	
		Replication - copy all the live data from 1 server to other
			there are different types (4 types)
		Mirroring - there are only 3 parties here
				Primary server
				Secondary server
				Agent
				Primary goes down, secondary becomes primary
				both goes down, business is down !!

One of the Hottest interview question
	What is the difference between function and procedure

	Microsoft calls it as SP - stored procesure
	Oracle they call it as only procedure

	Functions - are used for calculations and formatting the data
		are executed with sql queries (select dbo.functioname(...))
	Procs - are used for DML operations (insert, update and delete)
		are executed with exec key word

		return values
		functions can return only 1 value(and thats mandatory)
procedure can return multiple values using outdirection of parameter (does not need to return the value) - in your P0 this is most required feature for many of you 

	procedure can have below parameters
		input parameter (default direction)
		output parameter (need to be set)


----------------------------------------------------------------
	triggers are of 3 types
		before trigger (before the event)
		after trigger (after the event)
		instead of trigger (on the views not on table)

	before insert or update or delete of employee, 
		time check to be performed, if it does not meet the condition, we roll back operation

		eg. check for non working hours

	---
	after trigger is when insert or update or delete is successful, we want some other other query 
		to get fired

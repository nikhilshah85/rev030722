		Database Interaction
			a. SQL Statements (select, insert, delete, update) 
				-This is kind of slow and not so secured
				-You cannot program this, eg. if condition, loops, exceptions etc..
			b. TSQL (Transact SQL) - Prgrammed SQL
				- create objects, which will run sql faster, 
				- lots of security, gets you the encapsulation
				- Used for Automations

				TSQL Objects
				Functions (user defined functions)- for calculations and formatting
				Procedure (Block of Compiled SQL) for DML Operations
				Triggers (Automation)
					
				This objects when used, they will bring better performace to the 				application

		Automation, here referes to, developer or dba does not sit on the server and keep a watch or do anything manually
		Eg.1
			For an Employee table, 
				employee cannot be added(inserted), updated or delete during non work 				hours (Working hours 9AM -5PM - Monday to friday)

		Eg.2 When a customer buys a product, them amount should be auto calculated
			and product qty should also be reduced

		Eg.3 For a banking app, when a widraw or deposit or transfer is performed, 
			we want an entry to be maked in the transaction table

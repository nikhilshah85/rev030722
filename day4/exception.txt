Parent class, mark the method as Virtual, so child can have their own copies of method
	Keep all the common validations, formatting in the parent class method

use overrides in the child, make your validations for the child here 

How do you handle exceptions

	It is in 2 parts,
		1. In a class you use 
			throw new Exception(" error message ");
		2. In the calling env (main method in our case)
			use try...catch..finally block
	
		3. Exception is an class by framework
		similary you have more than 100 such classes
		eg. DivideByZeroException
		    FileNoFoundExcecption
		    NullReferenceException
		    SQLException
		4. try - lets try this code
		   catch - control comes here when there is an exception
		   finally - is a common block, use this block for 
				cleaning the resources, eg. close file

Async prog -- 
	A much needed feature, youtube keeps loading the video content in the background
	when we watch the video


	To achive this, we use Task as return type of a method
		and attach asyn and await


	public async Task<employee> GetEmployeeProfiles()
	{

		files = await getthefilesfromservercode(); //collect data in small chunk

		some code
		some code
		executing
		somecode
		int add = 10 + 20;

	}


	Threads has their own problem, Threads were for desktop app, not for web
		plus it had other problems
		Thus we have Task
		async, await and Task
Reflection

	Reflection is an technique to collect all the information from the object at runtime
	properties, methods, variables, enums, parameters everything 


	in REST api, webserver uses reflection, to get the data you have send and detect the properties to convert it into JSON

		select * from employees from .net appliction, 

		Reflection is used everywhere

		It can also create a new object at runtime



OWASP security





Reflection 
You walk into a bank, open me a new account
	banksoftware has more than 80 types of accounts

	if we write if condition for 80 type of account

	instead reflection will do it in 2 lines

		object newAccount = Reflection.Activate("Savings");

	ASP.Net MVC (web)
	C# - Delegates
	LINQ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		ASP - ActiveX Server Pages (1995 - 2001) (home.asp)
			you craete pages and put it on server
		ASP.Net - More improved with .net framework (ASP.Net 1.1) (aspx.pages)
			ASP.Net 2.0 and also included web services (SOAP messages)
			ASP.Net 3.5 (Advance Web Services) (home.aspx)
		ASP.Net MVC (MVC is a design pattern, for createing a much better application)
		ASP.Net MVC Core


		M - Model - Data - (this is the data part of application)
			Data access, CRUD operations, formatting, filter, sort, group, validate, 
			SP execution, transactions etc....
			Make a REST calls here to get the data (for security purpose) - C#
			(.cs file) - c# file
			may be read a excel, xml file or json file
		V - View - UI - (This is the User Interface, which use will see on their screen)	
			HTML,CSS,Javascript, Razor Syntax (mix and short hand all 3)
			images, videos, forms, textboxes etc.
			client side validations
			make a REST API calls here as well (JQuery)
				(for general data, which is not kind confendential or has anything on
				security)
			(.cshtml)
		C - Controller - (this is a communicater between M and V)
			Collect the data from model and give it to view
			and vice versa
			(.cs)
			Authentication, encryption, security, certificates, session management etc.

		Without MVC, 
			all the data related code, UI related activity and controller related activity
			used to be in a single file (ASP)

			in ASP.Net
			this single file was then divided into 2 parts
			a. UI 
			b. Data and Controller

			in ASP.Net MVC
			we made it 3 files
			a. UI
			b. Data
			c. Controller

			Object Oriented Programming (OOP / OOPS)

			Object - is an Real world entity 
			
				Object has - Properties - get and setter methods 
					   - Methods / Functions / Reactions
					   - Events 


			4 Pillars to design an object
				Abstraction
				Encapsulation
				Inheritance
				Polymorphism

			Abstraction - Consider only those properties and methods needed for software
				eg. Banking software - blood group may not be important
					height
				u will also strore the info in a database
				    but, for hospital software
			Encapsulation - Hide the implementation
					(Create things which are easy to use, but very very very difficult to understand on how it works)
			Inheritance - Reuse the code

			Polymorphism - Same Object, different behaviour

			Who is the father of C ? - Dennies Ritchie
			Who is the father of C++ / OOPS - Bjarne Stroustrup

				on google and some popular books, they say there are 2 types of polymorphism
								 some also says there are 3 types
				but there is only 1 type as per Bjarne Stroustrup

				Static Polymorphism/compile time -- Not Polymorphism
This is a technique of compiler called "Name mangling"  
					widraw(int amount) - widraw(int amount)_HJGH7969
					widraw(double amount) - widraw(double amount)_45YFHKDD
					widraw(int amount,datetime val) - widraw(int amount,datetime val)_JKj
						
				Runtime Polymorphism - this is real polymorphism
				Method overloading  - this is not polymorphism



		you write/implement all of this in a file (class file)
			Class - is a Blue print
				is a design file (document)
			

		You use a new keyword to instanciate a new Object of a class
					 (create a new object of a class)

			values are stored in a private variable
			we use properties to get the value and set the value to variables
				properties are public in nature

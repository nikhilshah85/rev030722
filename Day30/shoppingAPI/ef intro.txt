
EF : is an data access framework based on ORM pattern  - Object Relation Mapping

	 class will be mapped to database, which will have -->
	 class will be mapped to table in backend
		class will have propery mapped to columns in the table
	functions, constraints, procedures will be mapped to backend

	there are 2 modes to work here
		EF with database first approach (create a databse, tables, constrainrs, relations etc)
			classes will be generated by framework based on those tables in front end for mapping 
			then u can fire, LINQ queries on this table

		EF with Code first approach, you create classes, add properties, define relations, constraints 				etc. database and tables will be generated by framework 

	when to use ?
		DB First - when business is database driven , 
			Normalization is imp, u will have procs, triggers, views, functions lots of things
		Front end driven - when we are not sure about what backend we will go with
			SQL server ?
			Oracle ?
			NoSQL - MongoDB
			Azure or AWS ?
			We dont know, we decide later

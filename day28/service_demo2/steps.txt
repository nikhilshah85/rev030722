1. Create new project 
	ng new service_demo2
2. open the project in VS Code
3. delete all the contents from app.component.html
4. create new dir in the app folder
	cd src
	cd app
	mkdir components
	mkdir services
5. in the component folder, lets create 2 components
	ng g c productslist
	ng g c addnewproduct
6. similary, cd..
	    cd services
	 ng g s products
7. in the service, lets create a variable and a function

	Note : when we want to share some functionalities btween multiple components, we use service
		greetUser() is a function which needs to be used by 5-10 cmponents
			greetUser() may be 15 - 20 lines of code
	Note: When u create a new service, it nt refered or registerd anywhere

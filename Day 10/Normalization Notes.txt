Functional Dependency
	When you choose a Primary key for a table
	check every column, is functionally related to primary key

	if not, we need to remove that column and move it to other table

	They should not be related directly to any other column

Relationships

Partial Dependency - Where all the columnns are directly related to all the PK column (applicable only for 2NF)
Transitive Dependency - 

	1NF 
		a. Remove the Redunduncy from the table and move it to another table
		b. create the relationship between both the table
		C. Note
		if you add a new column, you are inviting new data which is never used, 
		or generated by the old system
		new column will take space, (storage space, IO space, space on ram, processing time)

		Make sure every table has a primary

	2NF - If your table does not have Concaneted Primary key, table is already in 2NF
		a. test each column with all the concanated pk column, this col should be functionally 
			dependend on any 1 of them
		b. remove those colums, apply 1NF on it, (choose a pk)

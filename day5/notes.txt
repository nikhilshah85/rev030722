After you compile the applciation, where does the output go ?
	Bin - Debug - net5.0 -- .exe / .dll
---------------
	If my project is using Conole APP with database
			This is called as 2 tier app
	if my project is using Database, Class Lib and Console APP
			This is called as 3 tier
	if my project is using Database,Rest API, Web APP, Class Lib
			This is called 4 tire
		u can keep adding more tires to your project and they say N-Tire

Question - how can you view the MSIL code ?
	when you install Visual Studio, you get a tool called ILDASM (intermediate language disambler)

	There are 3 types of serialization (Binary, XML, and SOAP)
Its a packet
	This will go to the service runnin on some server

	and then it will be opened (Deserialised)
	and process the query / data
	generate the output (SQL ROWS from table)
	Serrialize the output again into SOAP Packet
	send it back to browser, browser will deserialize it and show the data

		SOAP - Simple Object Access protocol 
		worked on HTTP/HTTPS Protocol
		
		This is an Idea and been accepted by Standard Web Organization
			W3C
		They put down the rules for exchange of data, conversion of data, compilers, languages
				format of soap, rulesetc,
			and this set of rules as 1 came to be known as a technology - we call it as 
				WEB SERVICES
		--------
		Web Services has been around since 2005 and had been great, only tech responsible for
		Enterprise application

		Every 5-10 years there is a revolution in IT
			
	<temperature:int32>30</temperature:int32> -- this looks very heavy in mobile data world
		More of meta data then data (not good for light weight devise)

	<lattitude:float>10.5</lattitude:float>
	<longitude:float>15.32</longitude:float>

	This is not suitable for slow network 

	Thus a ligher format of data is now available JSON
		10.5,15.2
		30
		so the rules has changed
		format of data has changed
		new serialization is in place JSONSerializer
		name of the tech has also changed (from Web Service, it now called REST)
			Representational State Transfer

			REST is the name of Standard

			based on this standard, Microsoft created 
				Compilers
				Classes, Libraries, methods, properties etc...
				and called it a Technology - WebAPI
			RESTAPI = WebAPI = JSON Service

			We will be createing the REST ful api services








		Age
		<age>30</age> --- XML
		<age:int32>30</age:int32> -- SOAP - SOAP is more elobrative

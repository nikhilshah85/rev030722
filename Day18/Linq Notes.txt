A business owner, gets more than 200 emails from accross the globe, for orders and shipment (in a day)
				 200 more during night time

	Thus he/she hired some executives to work on emails (emails has imp info, like senders phoneNo, senders Email, 
								address, lots of info which owner does not want exectutives to 
								know about)

	Thus an applicaction can be created which will connect to the mail exchange server/mailbox and display the dta
	which executives needs to wrk wth 

	XML - Xpath and XQuery
-------------
	For a developer, conneting to various sources and fire the query, for CRUD, sort, filter, group etc is challangeing
	Insted of learning all this differnt language and connecing and working with them
		let me give you a new framework(Microsoft)
	you talk to this framework only, and in the background, new framework will talk to all the source in their own language
